    " - n_estimators: default 'warn'. This is the number of trees in your model. The goal here is to pick the minimum amount of trees to achieve the lowest generalized loss. I usually pick ~500 to start and experiment with lower and higher numbers. the process of choosing trees is known as pruning. read more here: \n",
    " - criterion: 'mse' or 'mae'. mse is differentiable while mae is not. mse also penalizes samples that are very far.\n",
